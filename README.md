2025, December 2025.

This is the repository of Beat Neuenschwander's chess activities. It contains

- recent studies of mine and original studies first published in "beatochess"
- revised studies and comments on studies from other authors
  
The beatohess-issues folder contains all issues in pdf and html format as well as the pgn files can be found here. 
Subfolders are also publicly available but are only relevant for me.
